## Details

- Connects with Aneng BLE Multimeters using Bluetooth and announces values using Web Speech api.
- Reciprocates buzz with a tone of 2800 Hz.
- Only works with Aneng Big multimeters at the moment (Aneng-9002, BSIDE ZT-300AB, ZOYI ZT-300AB, BABATools AD-900).
- Thanks to @ludwich66 for decoding the protocol at https://github.com/ludwich66/Bluetooth-DMM/wiki/Protocol-all-Variants
- "Live value" shows instant value received from DMM.
- Live value is then debounced and repeat values are removed to get "Announced value".
- "Announced value" is shown in UI and also spoken using Web Speech api. The voice model used can be changed in UI (choice depends on OS).
- When multimeter's Buzz symbol is ON and DIODE symbol is OFF, that indicates multimeter is buzzing. The app also generates a tone of 2800 Hz with 70% volume to make the buzz more audible. (Actual multimeter uses 2150 Hz, but I like this one better.)
- Doesn't work on IOS, because Web Bluetooth Api is not supported. Works on Android, Mac, Windows.
- Supports PWA app installation and offline mode.

## Todo

- Support other size multimeters from Aneng
- Allow configuring volume, pitch, buzz volume, buzz frequency
- Allow custom template
